1. Download <a href="https://github.com/rnt-pmi/odin" target="_blank">Odin</a> from the GitHub repository.
2. Go to the odin folder you have just downloaded:
```
  cd path/to/odin
```
3. [OPTIONAL] Create a virtual environment:
```
  python -m venv venv
```
4. [OPTIONAL] Activate the virtual environment just created:
- On MacOS/Linux:
```
  source venv/bin/activate
```
- On Windows:
```
  .\venv\Scripts\activate
